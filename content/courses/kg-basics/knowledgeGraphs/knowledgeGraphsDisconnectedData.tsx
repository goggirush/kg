          <h2>Knowledge Graphs Integrate Disconnected Data</h2>
          <p>
            Large organizations often struggle with data spread across disconnected systems â€” each one using different formats, identifiers, or assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            A knowledge graph can serve as the <strong>semantic bridge</strong> between those systems:
          </p>
          <BulletList>
            <li>Connect tables, files, databases, APIs</li>
            <li>Resolve different identifiers for the same entity</li>
            <li>Create a unified view of things and how they relate</li>
          </BulletList>
          <p>
            This is called <strong>data federation</strong>. It allows systems to remain independent, but work together through a shared data layer.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a graph-based integration approach, Scania can unlock value from data that was previously siloed or inaccessible.
